The Audiolab MDAC (an audio device) has some problems with recent Linux kernel
versions due to split transaction scheduling in the ehci-hcd driver.

I'm going to investigate it further and push for a proper fix,
but in the meantime, there's this workaround.

It basically just patches ehci-sched.c with a reverting patch and rebuilds
and "installs" ehci-hcd.ko in /lib/modules. In a fully automated fashion.

The offending commits are
3e619d04159be54b3daa0b7036b0ce9e067f4b5d
e3420901eba65b1c46bed86d360e3a8685d20734 + 811c926c538f7e8d3c08b630dd5844efd7e000f6

This tool was created for "ordinary folk", and therefore, for Ubuntu.
If you're a skilled kernel programmer who maintains his own kernel,
then by all means revert the aforementioned commits and forget about
this simple Makefile "tool".



== How to use ==


=== Preparation ===

1) download a tarball/zip from Github's Tags page,
   https://github.com/comps/ehci-mdac/tags

2) extract it and "cd" into the directory

All temporary files will reside in this directory, so you can easily remove it
once all is done.

3) make sure you have at least 10GB of free disk space and several spare
   hours of computer time (ie. not running on battery) as the tool will run
   "make modules" on the kernel source, which - in case of Ubuntu - results in
   huge amount of modules and time wasted

This is because of CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled and Module.symvers required
(at least by Ubuntu kernels). The only solution I know of is to rebuild all
modules, so the Module.symvers file can be created.
If you're running your own lightweight nearly-module-less kernel, then
substitute "10GB" for "2GB" and "several hours" for "10 minutes", of course.

4) make sure to have "make" installed,
   sudo apt-get install make


=== Execution ===

If you don't mind the script building the modules with root privileges,
then by all means run "sudo make install". This is the recommended way
for most people.

As an alternative (or for debugging purposes), you can run each step manually:

1) install build dependencies (with minimal other deps),
   sudo make builddep

2) download, configure and build kernel source / modules, this might take ages,
   make source_prepare

3) patch the ehci-sched.c source,
   make patch

4) rebuild it,  (needed?)
   make build

5) copy the new .ko module to /lib/modules, don't call modules_install,
   which could remove more than we want,
   sudo make install


=== Cleanup ===

And that's about it!
Feel free to remove the unzipped directory and the downloaded zip/tarball.
